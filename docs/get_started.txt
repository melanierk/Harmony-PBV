-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this document, you will find instructions on how to start using Harmony.

We'll describe how to run Harmony with a sample program, A.cpp, which is
included in lto_test.  The process for running Harmony with other programs is
similar.

----
 
1) First, make sure you have properly installed Harmony by following the
instructions in docs/INSTALL. 

2) Next, compile the program

3)

4) Run the executable produced by the compilation in step 3).  A.cpp
takes no inputs, but if inputs are required in your program, they can be
provided as they would be normally.  

5) Find the produced profile, which is a binary representation of a
Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame object.  Now, you can use Pandas
to analyze, manipulate, or create visulizations of the profile data.  In the
next release, we plan to provide a few sample profile analysis tools.
Alternatively, you can use the script provided in analysis/ to dump the profile
to a text file.  Simply call:

	> ./analysis/load_profile.py A_profile.prof

----

You should be able to follow similar steps to compile any C or C++ program. 
Please remember, however, that programs which cannot be compiled with
clang/llvm will not be compileable with the Harmony-extended clang either. 

For notes on compiling the Parsec benchmark suite, see our special instructions
in docs/run_parsec.txt.
