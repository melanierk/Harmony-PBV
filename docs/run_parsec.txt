                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING PARSEC WITH HARMONY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parsec is a popular multithreaded benchmark suite from Princeton University
(see http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/). Parsec will not run "out of the box"
with Harmony. This is primarily because the version of clang that Harmony
inherits from requires strict adherance to C/C++ standards, and Parsec does not
always use ISO C/C++. 

To support users who want to run Parsec with Harmony, we have provided a few
helpful files in this distribution within the parsec/ directory.

1) First, there is a Parsec patch that modifies Parsec's package source files
to make them compilable by clang/LLVM. To use it, call:

2) Second, we provide a sample configuration file, parsec/harmony.bldconf, that
can be added via the Parsec management tool's bldconfadd program (see
http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/doc/man/man1/bldconfadd.1.html).

3) Finally, a sample runscript which makes calls to the Parsec management tool 
can be found in parsec/run.sh

When collecting and examining Parsec PBV profiles, it is important to note that
the current parsecmgmt tool does not provide a simple way to set the number of
threads executed across all of its benchmark programs.  A command line option,
"-n", allows users to easily set a minimum thread count threshold, but does not
guarantee any maximum thread count.  Maximum thread counts need to be set using
command line options or source modifications per benchmark program.
