                  A Tool for Collecting Parallel Block Vectors

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harmony is designed to efficiently collect parallel block vectors (PBVs),
profiles which establish a mapping between static basic blocks in a
multithreaded application and the degrees of parallelism exhibited in those
blocksâ€™ dynamic executions.  Harmony collects PBVs via compiler inserted
instrumentation and dynamic profiling.  It is built into the clang frontend
(www.clang.llvm.org/) for LLVM (www.llvm.org/).  User programs are compiled
with the modified version of clang, and at link time, an instrumentation pass
inserts profiling code across the entire program.  The resulting instrumented
executables can be run normally with any user inputs, and will produce their
original output as well as a PBV profile.

License
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harmony is released under the new BSD license like the clang LLVM frontend that
we've modified. Note that some of the included LLVM source included in this 
distribution is under MIT and UIUC licenses.

Project Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A quick start guide is available in docs/get_started.txt
* A profile post-processing toolkit will be released soon. For now, PBV profiles
  are output into Pandas (www.pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames. A script to dump
  the profiles to a csv-text format is provided in this initial release and
  discussed in the quick start guide. 
* See our ISCA 2012 paper, "Harmony: Collection and Analysis of Parallel Block
  Vectors", for more information about parallel block vectors, Harmony's 
  implementation, and for sample applications of this tool.
